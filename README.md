# About me
Hello, my name is Mpho Mafata. I am currently working as a post-doctoral fellow with the database team at the Center for Research on Evaluation Science and Technology (CREST), South Africa. Previously, I was a joint post-doctoral fellow at the South African Grape and Wine Research Institute (SAGWRI), as well as the Stellenbosch Universityâ€™s School for Data Science and Computational Thinking.
My research is in the applications of Data Science in the fields: Analytical Chemistry, Biotechnology, Sensory evaluation, and Oenology. Currently, I work on transdisciplinary approaches for chemometric and sensometric data fusion. My career goal is to extend my skills in data analysis to include more open-source software for wider applicability and independence. I aspires to continue to be an interdisciplinarian in integrating and interpreting data from different sources.
